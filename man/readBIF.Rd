\arguments{
\item{analysisName}{: filename of BIF/BIF6 file to read}

object of type MassImage or MassSpectra

\description{
Function to read ToF-SIMS data in the form of preprocessed BIF files
}
\details{
This function imports BIF files from IONTOF Surface Lab or ULVAC-PHI's
WinCadence. This function reads the data sequential directly from the
binary stream. Therefore it's rather slow, but uses less memory
than the \code{readBIFParallel} function.
