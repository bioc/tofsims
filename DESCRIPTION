Type: Package
Title: Import, process and analysis of Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry
          (ToF-SIMS) imaging data
Version: 1.5.0
Author: Lorenz Gerber, Viet Mai Hoang
Maintainer: Lorenz Gerber <genfys@gmail.com>
Depends: R (>= 3.3.0), methods, utils, ProtGenerics
Description: This packages offers a pipeline for import, processing and analysis of ToF-SIMS
          2D image data. Import of Iontof and Ulvac-Phi raw or preprocessed data is
          supported. For rawdata, mass calibration, peak picking and peak integration exist.
          General funcionality includes data binning, scaling, image subsetting and
          visualization. A range of multivariate tools common in the ToF-SIMS community are
          implemented (PCA, MCR, MAF, MNF). An interface to the bioconductor image processing
          package EBImage offers image segmentation functionality.
